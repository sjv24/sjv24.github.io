            <h1>Mood Tracker</h1>
            <p>
                I built a beginner-friendly sentiment analysis project where users can input daily journal entries. After a week, the data is analyzed to calculate their average mood and display trends with fun feedback messages.
            </p>

            <h2>Why This Project?</h2>
            <p>
                While I was casually browsing the internet, I stumbled upon the term sentiment analysis, and it instantly grabbed my attention. Naturally, I had to dig deeper to understand what it’s all about. So, what exactly is Sentiment Analysis? Well, to put it simply, it’s the process of analyzing digital text to figure out the emotional tone behind it—whether it’s positive, negative, or neutral. It’s amazing how it can help us understand people’s feelings just by looking at what they write!This sparked the idea to build a small project for a hands-on experience.
            </p>
            
            <h2>How It Works?</h2>
            <p>
                In this project, users can enter their daily journal entries to share how their day is going. After a week, the data is analyzed, and a polarity score is calculated for each entry. This helps determine the user’s average weekly mood. For some added fun, the user also gets a personalized feedback message based on their mood! Plus, they can visualize their mood trends over the week in a neat line graph for better insight.
           </p>
            
            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>
                I learnt how to use TextBlob and also realised how easy it was to use the library and get a polarity score for a selected text.
            </p>

            <h2>Future Scope</h2>
            <p>
                Later on I plan on showing users their future mood predictions using the weekly data collected. I didn't plan on doing that right now because the size of my data is really small.
