            <h1>Internly â€“ Internship Management Platform</h1>

            <p>
                Internly is a platform My team and I built to connect students with companies offering internships. It streamlines the process of posting, applying, and managing internships, making life easier for both students and employers.
            </p>

            <h2>Why This Project?</h2>
            <p>
                My friends and I noticed that many students struggled to find internships, and companies often had a hard time managing applications efficiently. So we wanted to build a solution that simplifies this process, making it transparent, organized, and user-friendly. Internly is designed to solve real-world problems while showcasing my skills in full-stack web development.
            </p>

            <h2>How It Works?</h2>
            <p>
                Internly is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, with Node.js and MySQL handling the backend and database management. Students can create accounts, browse internship listings, and apply directly through the platform. Companies can post internships, track applications, and manage their profiles efficiently. Everything is stored securely in a database and updates dynamically based on user actions.
            </p>

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>
                Building Internly taught me a lot about full-stack development and database management. I gained hands-on experience with Node.js, MySQL queries, and frontend-backend integration. This project also helped me understand how to design user-friendly interfaces, validate forms, and handle dynamic data efficiently. It was a rewarding experience to see the platform function smoothly and be ready for real users.
            </p>

            <h2>Future Scope</h2>
            <p>
                In the future, I plan to enhance Internly by adding AI-powered internship recommendations based on student profiles and preferences. I also want to implement a notification system to alert students about new opportunities and deadlines. Additionally, integrating analytics for companies to track applications and student engagement is on the roadmap.
            </p>
